Early on made moves I didn't want to reverse.  Got myself pitched out ~100ft.  Mild panic but looked through my options.  Tried MANY different downclimbing options, fretful most of the way.  Back on Solid ground: 9:41am.  Recollected myself and pushed forward.  Traced the route the single party above me on the wall took.  Much easier.  Made good progress, trusted my movement, head was clear but I was never truly comfortable because of the first attempt.  Still had to reverse a couple of sections (onsight - unfamiliar with options).  Cathedral Peak Summit: 11:06am.  Spent 10 minutes on the summit just taking in the views.  Unbelieveable.  Reflected on the climb/experience.  Wasn't certain I'd want to free solo, let alone climb ever again.  Know I'll never get myself into that situation again.  The pure freedom and amount of terrain you can cover solo, unaided is impressive.  Addicting.  ""4th class"" descent is enigmatic, decided to take some easy 5th instead because it was more straightforward.  Ate some snacks and got hassled by a marmot.  Finish back at TH: 12:49pm.

California,Tuolumne,Fairview Dome,,,,Regular Route,route,9,12,3,trad,,2,0,,"An okay climb to an awesome summit.  Waited for roughly 2 hours behind two parties, the lead party of 3 climbing slow and belaying both followers separately.  Our party of 4 stayed on their tail without much trouble.  Be prepared for crowds and waits.  Crescent Ledge belay options are okay but I was hoping for better.  Ended up building my anchor to the far right with all of the larger gear I had left.Linked P6 and 7 with ease, the belay 'ledge' was crowded with 2 people though.The uppersections of the climb have easy terrain, you just have to look for it.",
California,Tuolumne,Lamb Dome,,,,On The Lamb,route,9,4,2,trad,,4,0,,"Outrageous feature which makes for a stellar climb. Finding the start was trickier than expected, after finding the ledge with a tree 100' up, continue up the crack on the right side, it will curve over to a bushy ledge which is the belay for the 5.4 bit. Wanted to try the OtL, Oz, HB linkup but we spent too long finding the start. Finished the other climbs the next day, and am stoked to try the linkup another time! There is a bolted belay after turning the corner about 15 feet below the crack which is easy to access. For the second traverse belay, we setup in the small corner near the Jailbreak intersection. Superb overall!",

California,Tuolumne,Mariolumne Dome,,,,Hobbit Book,route,7,4,2,trad,,3,2,,"Fantastic route! Finding the belay at the top of P1 was a little tricky but not bad. We also belayed at the comfy ledge below the top of P2 instead of below the overhanging wall. This made it a pleasant belay, and we still had plenty of rope for P3 (now more direct w/ less drag).  The classic P3 was incredible, such fun beautiful patina features. Definitely runout and deserves the R. I thought a couple spots felt a tad harder than 5.7 but there were lots of options and I may have just not taken the path of least resistance.  Belay at the top of the climb was a little awkward, I chose to belay right near the edge so I could hear my partner. There are probably options further up the dome summit.  Easy approach after climbing Oz. Approaching Mariolumne just for this climb does not seem worth the full talus/scramble approach to me.",
